# Portfolio

## Description
* This project is a personal portfolio of my work with room for more projects coming soon! 

## User Story
* AS AN employer I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position. 

## Acceptance Criteria
* GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work -
* WHEN I load their portfolio THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them.
* WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section.
* WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications.
* WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others.
* WHEN I click on the images of the applications THEN I am taken to that deployed application.
* WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport.
